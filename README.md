# manokara's iced widgets

A collection of widgets for `iced`.

## Building

Add the following to your `[dependencies]` section in `Cargo.toml`:

```
iced_widgets = { git = "https://github.com/manokara/iced_widgets" }
```

While there is not tagged released yet, that crate spec will give you the latest commit and keep it
at that unless you run `cargo update`.

## Widget List

- `Hexview`: A view into binary data. It has quite a few styling options, you can move a
  cursor around and also select things, but that doesn't do anything yet.
